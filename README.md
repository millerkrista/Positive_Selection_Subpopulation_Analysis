# Positive Selection and Subpopulation Analysis of HIV-1 *env* gene
This project was done as part of the National Institutes of Health's Graduate Data Science Summer Program. I worked under Frida Belinky, a computational biologist with Eli Boritz's lab at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. With Frida's mentorship, I created a novel workflow for analyzing high-throughput single-genome sequencing data from 40 participants with chronic HIV infection. 

## Biological Question
When looking at sequence alignments of a single participant's HIV-1 population, there seemed to be distinct subpopulations formed by the presence of different haplotypes (image of example alignment shown below).
